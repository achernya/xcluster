.TH XCLUSTER 1 "July 3, 1995"
.UC 4
.SH NAME
xcluster \- display MIT map, give info about Athena clusters
.SH SYNOPSIS
xcluster [-help] [-rv] [-inactive timeout] [-auto time]
         [-geometry {+/-}x{+/-}y]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Xcluster
displays a map of the MIT campus and marks the location of Project
Athena public clusters with an "X".  The user can click
on the map, and information about the cluster nearest the mouse-click
is displayed.  The clusters are also listed in a row of buttons below
the map, and the user may click one of those buttons instead.
.PP
Once a cluster has been selected, a circle is drawn around it so that it
is more easily spotted.
.I Xcluster
then contacts a server that tracks the number of workstations
free and in-use for each cluster, and displays that information for the
cluster chosen.  Printer status for that cluster is also displayed, as
well as phone number(s), where available.
.PP
Xcluster can also run in a non-interactive mode, where it cycles
through the clusters automatically. It can also be made to cycle
through a series of foreground and background colors, to prevent
screen burn-in on the dedicated xcluster machines that run this
program all the time.

.SH OPTIONS
.PD 0
.TP 21
.B \-rv
display map and window in reverse-video
.TP 21
.B \-inactive timeout
exit after
.I timeout
seconds of inactivity.
.TP 21
.B \-auto time
cycle through the clusters, selecting each for 
.I time
seconds.
.TP 21
.B \-geometry
specify an x,y location for placement of window
.TP 21
.B \-zoom
causes the campus map to be moved and resized to the largest size such
that all of the clusters still fit.
.TP 21
.B \-warp
causes the pointer to be warped to the top, left corner of the screen
when xcluster starts up.
.TP 21
.B \-color[012] colors
specify a set of colors to be cycled through.
.I colors
should be a space-separated list of X colors.
.TP 21
.B \-fg color
specifies the foreground color for the map and text. If
.I color
is one of the color sets
.I color0\fP, \fIcolor1\fP, or \fIcolor2\fP,
then the foreground color will cycle through the colors in that set.
.TP 21
.B \-bg color

.TP 21
.B \-circlecolor
specifies the color or colors for the circles and arrows on the
cluster map.
.TP 21
.B \-changetime time
specifies how many seconds pass between color changes. The default is
3600 (one hour).
